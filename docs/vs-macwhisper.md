## The Key Differences

### 1. AI is Built-In

**MacWhisper:** Transcription only. For summaries, you copy text to ChatGPT/Claude.

**Private Transcript:** Summaries, action items, and insights generated locally with Ollama. No copy-paste, no cloud.

### 2. Professional Focus

**MacWhisper:** General-purpose transcription for anyone.

**Private Transcript:** Built for professionals who need:
- HIPAA compliance (therapists)
- Privilege protection (attorneys)
- IRB compliance (researchers)
- Structured notes (SOAP, DAP, legal formats)

### 3. Cross-Platform

**MacWhisper:** Mac only. If your firm uses Windows, you need something else.

**Private Transcript:** Works on Mac, Windows, and Linux. One solution for any environment.

### 4. RAG / Chat with Transcripts

**MacWhisper:** Can't search across transcripts semantically.

**Private Transcript:** Ask questions like "What did John say about the budget across all meetings?" and get answers from your local transcript database.
