## The Core Difference

### Descript's Magic Trick

Descript lets you edit audio by editing the transcript. Delete a word from the text, it's deleted from the audio. It's impressive technology.

**But:**
- Your audio is uploaded to their cloud
- You pay monthly forever
- It's overkill if you don't need editing

### Private Transcript's Focus

We don't edit audio. We transcribe and add intelligence:
- AI summaries and action items
- Professional note templates
- Semantic search across all transcripts
- Everything local and private

**If you don't edit audio**, you're paying for features you don't use.

## Use Case Comparison

### Podcaster Who Edits

**Choose Descript if:**
- You edit podcasts by editing text
- You use Overdub (AI voice)
- You create audiograms/clips
- Privacy isn't critical

**But consider:** You'll pay $360/year for Pro. Over 5 years, that's $1,800.

### Podcaster Who Just Needs Transcripts

**Choose Private Transcript if:**
- You just need show notes and transcripts
- You edit in a DAW (Logic, Audacity)
- You want unlimited transcription
- You prefer one-time payment

**Cost:** $39 total, forever.

### Professional Recording Meetings

**Choose Private Transcript because:**
- Descript's editing features are irrelevant
- You need privacy (Descript is cloud)
- You need SOAP/DAP/legal templates (Descript doesn't have them)
- You don't want monthly fees for features you won't use

## The Honest Assessment

### When Descript is Better

1. **You edit podcasts** — The edit-audio-by-editing-text feature is unique
2. **You need video editing** — Descript handles video too
3. **You use Overdub** — AI voice cloning for corrections
4. **You're a production team** — Collaboration features

### When Private Transcript is Better

1. **You just need transcripts** — Don't pay for editing you won't use
2. **Privacy matters** — Local-only beats cloud every time
3. **Professional use** — HIPAA, legal, research templates
4. **Budget-conscious** — One-time beats monthly

---

## Migration

### From Descript

If you're leaving Descript:

1. **Export transcripts** from Descript (plain text or SRT)
2. **Download your audio/video** files
3. **Import into Private Transcript**
4. **Cancel Descript subscription**

You keep your content. Just stop paying monthly.

### Using Both

Some podcasters use both:
- **Descript** for editing episodes
- **Private Transcript** for interview transcription and research

This makes sense if you do heavy audio editing but also record non-podcast content.

---

## The Bottom Line

**Descript** is an audio/video editing tool with transcription. It's brilliant for podcasters who edit.

**Private Transcript** is a transcription tool with AI intelligence. It's for anyone who needs transcripts but doesn't edit audio.

If you need audio editing → Descript
If you need private transcription + AI → Private Transcript
If you need both → Use both, but consider if you really need Descript's monthly fee
