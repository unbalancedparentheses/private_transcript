# Private Transcript for Therapists & Mental Health Professionals

## The Problem

You're a therapist. You want to transcribe sessions to:
- Write better progress notes
- Review what was said
- Track patient themes over time
- Generate SOAP/DAP notes faster

But you can't use Otter, Fireflies, or any cloud service because:

**Every word your client says is protected health information (PHI).**

Uploading therapy audio to a cloud service is a HIPAA violation waiting to happen.

## Why Cloud Transcription Violates HIPAA

### The HIPAA Security Rule Requires:

1. **Access controls** — Only authorized persons can access PHI
2. **Audit controls** — Track who accessed what, when
3. **Transmission security** — Encrypt PHI in transit
4. **Business Associate Agreements** — Contracts with any third party handling PHI

### Cloud Transcription Fails On All Counts:

| Requirement | What Cloud Services Do | The Problem |
|-------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Access controls | Their employees can access | You don't control who sees your audio |
| Audit controls | Their logs, not yours | You can't audit their access |
| Transmission security | Audio uploaded to their servers | PHI leaves your control |
| BAA | Most don't offer them | No legal protection |

**Even if a service claims to be "HIPAA compliant":**
- They still have your audio
- They can still be breached
- They can still be subpoenaed
- You're still trusting a third party with PHI

## How Private Transcript is Different

**Your audio never leaves your device. Period.**

| HIPAA Requirement | How We Comply |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Access controls | Only you can access your data |
| Audit controls | Local logs on your machine |
| Transmission security | Nothing transmitted—it's all local |
| BAA | Not needed—no third party involved |

There's no server to breach. No employee who can access your files. No subpoena target. Just you and your laptop.

## HIPAA Compliance Breakdown

### What HIPAA Requires

> "Covered entities must implement technical safeguards to guard against unauthorized access to ePHI transmitted over an electronic network."

### Why Cloud Fails

When you upload audio to Otter:
1. PHI is transmitted over the internet
2. Stored on Otter's servers
3. Processed by Otter's systems
4. Potentially accessed by Otter employees
5. Subject to Otter's security (and breaches)

### Why Local Passes

When you use Private Transcript:
1. PHI never transmitted—stays on your device
2. Stored locally, encrypted
3. Processed by software you control
4. No third-party access
5. Your security, your control

**No transmission = no transmission security requirements.**

## Real Scenarios

### Scenario 1: You Use Otter

1. You record a therapy session
2. Upload to Otter for transcription
3. Otter stores your audio on AWS
4. Three months later, Otter has a data breach
5. Your patient's session audio is exposed
6. You must notify the patient, file with HHS, face potential penalties

**Cost:** Reputation damage, OCR investigation, potential fines up to $50,000 per violation

### Scenario 2: You Use Private Transcript

1. You record a therapy session
2. Transcribe locally on your laptop
3. Audio never leaves your device
4. Three months later... nothing happens
5. Your patient's data is exactly where it should be: on your encrypted drive

**Cost:** $39 one-time

## What Your Colleagues Are Doing

**The risky approach:**
> "I use Otter because it's convenient. I'm sure it's fine."

**The reality:**
- No BAA in place
- PHI on third-party servers
- One breach away from an OCR complaint

**The compliant approach:**
> "I transcribe locally. My patients' audio never touches the cloud."

**The reality:**
- No third-party involvement
- No transmission of PHI
- HIPAA compliance by design

## FAQ

**"Is this actually HIPAA compliant?"**

HIPAA requires protecting PHI during transmission and storage. Since Private Transcript never transmits PHI (everything is local), the transmission requirements don't apply. Your local storage is protected by encryption. This is compliant by design.

**"Do I need a BAA?"**

No. BAAs are required when a third party handles PHI. Private Transcript is software that runs on your computer—we never see or handle your data. There's no third party.

**"What if my laptop is stolen?"**

Your transcripts are encrypted with AES-256. Without your password, they're unreadable. We also recommend full-disk encryption (FileVault on Mac, BitLocker on Windows) for additional protection.

**"Can I use this for telehealth sessions?"**

Yes. Record system audio to capture both sides of a video call, then transcribe locally.

**"What about client consent?"**

You should always get informed consent before recording. We recommend a simple consent form explaining that recordings are stored locally on your device, never uploaded to the cloud.
