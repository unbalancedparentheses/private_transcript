## Privacy: The Real Difference

### How Otter Works

```
Your voice → Internet → Otter's servers → Processing → Storage
                              ↓
                    Their employees can access
                    Subject to subpoenas
                    Vulnerable to breaches
                    Stored indefinitely
```

### How Private Transcript Works

```
Your voice → Your computer → Processing → Your storage
                              ↓
                    Only you can access
                    Nothing to subpoena
                    Nothing to breach
                    You control retention
