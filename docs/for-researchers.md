# Private Transcript for Researchers & Academics

## The Problem

You're conducting research interviews. Your IRB protocol requires:
- Participant confidentiality
- Secure data storage
- No unnecessary third-party access
- Data deletion after study completion

**Most transcription services violate all of these requirements.**

---

## Why Cloud Transcription Fails IRB Requirements

### Typical IRB Data Security Requirements:

1. **Minimize third-party access** — Only research team should access data
2. **Secure storage** — Encryption, access controls
3. **Data retention limits** — Delete after study ends
4. **Participant confidentiality** — Protect identity and responses

### What Cloud Services Do:

| Requirement | Cloud Services | The Problem |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| Third-party access | Their employees can access | Unauthorized access to research data |
| Secure storage | Their servers, their security | You don't control security |
| Data retention | Often indefinite | Can't guarantee deletion |
| Confidentiality | Audio stored on third-party servers | Participant privacy compromised |

**Your IRB probably didn't approve "upload participant interviews to a company's cloud servers."**

## How Private Transcript Meets IRB Standards

| IRB Requirement | How We Comply |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Minimize access | Only you access data—no third party |
| Secure storage | Local, encrypted with AES-256 |
| Data retention | You control deletion completely |
| Confidentiality | Audio never leaves your device |

**There's no third party. No server. No cloud. Just your research on your computer.**

## Features for Research

### Interview Transcription

- **Speaker diarization** — Separate interviewer from participant
- **Timestamp precision** — Reference specific moments
- **Verbatim mode** — Include ums, pauses, fillers
- **Clean mode** — Remove disfluencies for analysis

### Qualitative Analysis Support

- **Coding/tagging** — Apply codes to segments
- **Theme extraction** — AI identifies recurring themes
- **Quote extraction** — Pull key quotes with timestamps
- **Cross-interview search** — Find patterns across participants

### Participant Management

- **Anonymization** — Replace names with P1, P2, P3
- **Secure folders** — Organize by study, participant
- **Consent tracking** — Note consent status per recording
- **Data lifecycle** — Archive or delete per protocol

### Export for Analysis

- **NVivo format** — Import directly into NVivo
- **Atlas.ti format** — Compatible export
- **CSV export** — For quantitative analysis
- **Plain text** — For any qualitative software

## IRB Compliance Made Simple

### What You Tell Your IRB:

> "Interview recordings will be transcribed using local software that does not transmit data to external servers. All audio and transcripts will be stored on an encrypted local drive accessible only to the research team. Data will be deleted according to the retention schedule in this protocol."

### Why This Works:

- ✅ No third-party data processor
- ✅ No cloud storage to audit
- ✅ No BAA or DPA required
- ✅ Full control over retention
- ✅ Easy to demonstrate compliance

## Real Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Using Otter for Research Interviews

1. You record participant interviews
2. Upload to Otter for transcription
3. IRB auditor asks: "Where is the data stored?"
4. You answer: "On Otter's servers"
5. Auditor: "Was this approved in your protocol?"
6. Protocol violation. Study paused. IRB review.

### Scenario 2: Using Private Transcript

1. You record participant interviews
2. Transcribe locally on your laptop
3. IRB auditor asks: "Where is the data stored?"
4. You answer: "On my encrypted university laptop"
5. Auditor: "Perfect. Matches your protocol."
6. Audit passed. Research continues.

- **Think-aloud protocols** — Capture user commentary
- **Diary studies** — Transcribe participant recordings
- **Stakeholder interviews** — Document requirements

### Clinical Research

- **Patient interviews** — HIPAA-compliant (see [For Healthcare](./for-healthcare.md))
- **Clinician interviews** — Protected health information safe
- **Observational notes** — Audio memos transcribed locally

### Social Science

- **Survey follow-ups** — Transcribe open-ended responses
- **Expert interviews** — Academic and professional sources
- **Policy research** — Stakeholder consultations

## Working with Your IRB

### Protocol Language to Include:

> "Audio recordings will be transcribed using Private Transcript, a locally-installed software application. The software processes audio entirely on the researcher's device without transmitting data to external servers. Transcripts and audio files will be stored on an encrypted drive in accordance with university data security policies."

### Questions Your IRB Might Ask:

**"Does the software company have access to the data?"**

No. Private Transcript runs entirely on your computer. There are no servers, no accounts, no data transmission. The company never sees your data.

**"Where is the data stored?"**

On your local device, in an encrypted database. You control the storage location and can place it on an approved network drive if required.

**"How is deletion handled?"**

You delete files directly from your computer. Since there's no cloud backup, deletion is permanent and verifiable.

**"Is there a data processing agreement?"**

Not needed. DPAs are for third-party processors. Since all processing happens on your device, there's no third party.

## Getting Started

1. **Download** Private Transcript
2. **Create workspace** (select "Research" for academic templates)
3. **Set up study folders** — One per project or participant
4. **Configure anonymization** — Auto-replace names if needed
5. **Transcribe locally** — Audio stays on your device
6. **Export for analysis** — NVivo, Atlas.ti, CSV, or plain text

Your participants trusted you with their stories. Keep that trust.

## FAQ

**"Is this approved for human subjects research?"**

Private Transcript is software that runs on your computer. It doesn't collect, store, or transmit research data—you do. Whether it's appropriate depends on your protocol, but since no data leaves your device, it's generally easier to get approved than cloud services.

**"Can I use this for funded research?"**

Yes. Many grant-funded projects require data security. Local-only processing often exceeds security requirements for cloud-based alternatives.

**"What about data sharing requirements?"**

You can export transcripts in any format. The difference is you control when and how data is shared—it doesn't happen automatically through a third-party service.

**"Does it work on university computers?"**

Yes. It's a standard desktop application. No admin rights needed for basic installation on most systems.
