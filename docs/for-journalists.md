# Private Transcript for Journalists & Investigators

## The Problem

You're working on an investigation. Your sources spoke on condition of anonymity. Your recordings contain:
- Whistleblower interviews
- Confidential sources
- Sensitive documents discussed
- Evidence of wrongdoing

**If you upload this to a cloud service, you've compromised everything.**

## Why Cloud Transcription Endangers Sources

### What Happens When You Use Otter:

1. **Audio uploaded** to Otter's servers
2. **Stored** on their infrastructure (AWS, probably)
3. **Accessible** to their employees
4. **Subject to subpoenas** from law enforcement
5. **Vulnerable** to hacking by adversaries

### The Risks:

| Threat | What Could Happen |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Subpoena** | Government demands your interview recordings |
| **Breach** | Hackers steal confidential source interviews |
| **Insider threat** | Company employee leaks your audio |
| **Corporate pressure** | Subject of investigation pressures company |
| **Foreign governments** | State actors target cloud provider |

**Your source trusted you. Not Otter. Not AWS. You.**

## How Private Transcript Protects Sources

| Threat | Cloud Services | Private Transcript |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| Subpoena | Server can be subpoenaed | Nothing to subpoena—no servers |
| Breach | Provider gets hacked | Nothing to hack—it's on your device |
| Insider threat | Their employees access | No employees—it's your laptop |
| Corporate pressure | Company can comply | No company involvement |
| State actors | Cloud = target | Local = harder to target |

**Your recordings never leave your device. There's nothing for anyone to take.**

## Source Protection Deep Dive

### The Legal Landscape

Journalist's privilege (shield laws) vary by jurisdiction. But even strong shield laws can't protect what you've already given to a third party.

**The Third-Party Doctrine:**
Information voluntarily shared with third parties loses constitutional protection. When you upload to Otter, you've shared with a third party.

### Subpoena Scenarios

**Scenario A: You used Otter**
1. Prosecutor wants your source interview
2. You claim journalist's privilege
3. Prosecutor subpoenas Otter directly
4. Otter must comply—you're not even notified
5. Source exposed. Trust destroyed. Career damaged.

**Scenario B: You used Private Transcript**
1. Prosecutor wants your source interview
2. You claim journalist's privilege
3. Prosecutor must come to you
4. You fight it in court
5. Source protected. Privilege intact.

### The Difference

Cloud services are third parties with no journalistic obligation. They will comply with legal demands. The only way to protect your sources is to never involve third parties.

## Real Scenarios

### Investigative Reporting

You're investigating corporate fraud. A whistleblower inside the company agrees to speak.

**The wrong approach:**
- Record interview on phone
- Upload to Otter for transcription
- Otter now has evidence linking your source to the leak
- Company's lawyers can subpoena Otter
- Whistleblower fired, blacklisted, possibly prosecuted

**The right approach:**
- Record interview on dedicated recorder
- Transcribe locally with Private Transcript
- Audio stays on encrypted laptop
- No third-party involvement
- Source protected

### War Correspondence

You're interviewing civilians in a conflict zone. They're sharing evidence of war crimes.

**The wrong approach:**
- Use cloud transcription
- Audio routed through servers in unknown jurisdictions
- Hostile governments may have access
- Sources and their families at risk

**The right approach:**
- Transcribe locally, offline
- Audio never leaves your device
- Nothing to intercept
- Sources protected

## Threat Modeling for Journalists

### Low-Threat Stories
- Corporate profiles
- Event coverage
- Human interest

Even here, local is better. No reason to create unnecessary data copies.

### Medium-Threat Stories
- Local political corruption
- Business investigations
- Legal cases

Cloud transcription creates real risk. Subjects of investigation may use legal process to unmask sources.

### High-Threat Stories
- National security
- Organized crime
- Intelligence agencies
- Authoritarian governments

**Never use cloud services.** Air-gap everything. Local transcription is essential.

## FAQ

**"Is this really more secure than Otter?"**

Otter stores your audio on their servers, where it can be subpoenaed, breached, or accessed by employees. Private Transcript has no servers—nothing to subpoena, breach, or access.

**"What if my laptop is seized?"**

Your transcripts are encrypted. Without your password, they're unreadable. Use full-disk encryption (FileVault/BitLocker) and a strong password. Consider plausible deniability options for high-risk work.

**"Can I use this for podcast interviews?"**

Yes, though for non-sensitive content, the security benefits matter less. Still a good practice.

**"Does it work offline?**

Yes. You can transcribe with no internet connection. Perfect for working in the field or on air-gapped systems.

**"What about very long interviews?"**

Handles recordings of any length. For multi-hour interviews, transcription takes longer but there's no limit.
