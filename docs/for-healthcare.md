# Private Transcript for Healthcare Professionals

## The Problem

You're a physician, nurse, or healthcare administrator. You want to:
- Dictate clinical notes faster
- Transcribe patient consultations
- Document procedures
- Create accurate medical records

**But every word involves Protected Health Information (PHI).**

Cloud transcription services create HIPAA liability you don't need.

## Why Cloud Transcription is a HIPAA Risk

### HIPAA Requires:

1. **Minimum necessary standard** — Only share PHI when essential
2. **Business Associate Agreements** — Contracts with anyone handling PHI
3. **Breach notification** — Report unauthorized disclosures
4. **Security safeguards** — Technical, physical, administrative

### Cloud Transcription Fails:

| Requirement | Cloud Services | The Risk |
|-------------|----------------|----------|
| Minimum necessary | Audio uploaded unnecessarily | PHI shared beyond need |
| BAA | Many don't offer them | No legal protection |
| Breach notification | Their breach = your problem | You must notify patients |
| Security safeguards | You trust their security | No control over PHI |

## How Private Transcript Eliminates Risk

**PHI never leaves your device.**

| HIPAA Requirement | Private Transcript |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Minimum necessary | No sharing—all local |
| BAA | Not needed—no third party |
| Breach notification | No external breach possible |
| Security safeguards | You control everything |

**No transmission of PHI = dramatically reduced HIPAA scope.**

## HIPAA Deep Dive

### The Security Rule

> "Covered entities must implement technical safeguards to guard against unauthorized access to ePHI that is being transmitted over an electronic communications network."

**Key insight:** If PHI isn't transmitted, transmission safeguards don't apply.

### The Privacy Rule

> "A covered entity must make reasonable efforts to limit access to PHI to those persons who need access."

**Cloud services expand access.** Engineers, support staff, and systems at the transcription company can potentially access your audio. That's not "minimum necessary."

### The Breach Notification Rule

> "Covered entities must notify affected individuals following a breach of unsecured PHI."

**Cloud services get breached regularly.** When Otter or Fireflies has a breach, you'll be notifying patients and reporting to HHS.

**Local processing eliminates this risk.** If your laptop is properly encrypted, even theft isn't a reportable breach.

## Comparison: Cloud vs Local

### Using a Cloud Service

```
Patient audio → Internet → Cloud servers → Processing → Storage
                    ↓
            Multiple HIPAA risks:
            - Transmission security
            - Third-party access
            - Storage security
            - Breach liability
```

### Using Private Transcript

```
Patient audio → Your device → Local processing → Local storage
                    ↓
            Your existing HIPAA compliance:
            - Device encryption (you already have this)
            - Access controls (your login)
            - Physical security (your office)
```

**No new risks. No new compliance burdens.**

## Real Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Dictating Notes with Cloud Service

1. You dictate a patient note using Dragon Medical One
2. Audio sent to Nuance cloud
3. Nuance has a data incident (happens regularly)
4. Patient PHI potentially exposed
5. Breach investigation, notifications, potential penalties

### Scenario 2: Dictating Notes Locally

1. You dictate a patient note using Private Transcript
2. Audio processed on your laptop
3. Nothing transmitted, nothing at risk
4. PHI stays exactly where it should—on your secured device

## Integration with Healthcare Workflows

### EHR Integration

Private Transcript doesn't directly integrate with EHRs (Epic, Cerner, etc.)—and that's intentional. Direct integration would require data sharing.

Instead:
1. Dictate or record
2. Transcribe locally
3. Review and edit
4. Copy-paste into your EHR

This keeps PHI local while still improving documentation speed.

### Telehealth

Recording telehealth visits?
1. Record system audio (captures both sides)
2. Transcribe locally
3. No patient audio on third-party servers

### Multi-Site Practice

Each provider uses Private Transcript on their own device:
- No shared cloud account
- No cross-site PHI exposure
- Each location manages their own data

---

## Getting Started

1. **Download** Private Transcript (HIPAA-friendly—no account needed)
2. **Install** on your work device
3. **Configure** templates for your specialty
4. **Record** consultations, dictations, procedures
5. **Transcribe** locally—PHI never uploaded
6. **Export** to your EHR or documentation system

Your patients trust you with their health information. Don't upload it to random cloud servers.

## Pricing

| Tier | Price | For Healthcare |
|------|-------|----------------|
| Free | $0 | Basic dictation, text export |
| Pro | $39 one-time | Medical vocabulary, templates, AI notes |

No subscription. No per-provider licensing. No BAA needed.

## FAQ

**"Don't I need a BAA?"**

BAAs are required when a third party handles PHI. Private Transcript runs on your computer—we never see, touch, or store your data. No third party = no BAA needed.

**"Is this really HIPAA compliant?"**

HIPAA compliance is about how you handle PHI. Since Private Transcript processes everything locally and we never access your data, there's no new HIPAA burden. Your existing device security and access controls apply.

**"What about voice recognition accuracy for medical terms?"**

Whisper (our underlying engine) handles medical terminology well. For specialty terms, you can add custom vocabulary to improve accuracy.

**"Can multiple providers share transcripts?"**

You can export transcripts and share them through your existing HIPAA-compliant channels (secure email, EHR). The software itself doesn't sync or share data—that's intentional.

**"Does this work for inpatient documentation?"**

Yes, as long as you have a laptop or workstation where you can install software and record audio.
