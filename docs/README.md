# Private Transcript Documentation

## Why Private Transcript?

Most transcription services send your audio to the cloud. For many professionals, that's not just inconvenient—it's a liability.

**Private Transcript runs 100% on your device.** No cloud. No uploads. No risk.

## The Problem with Cloud Transcription

When you use Otter, Fireflies, or any cloud service:

1. **Your audio is uploaded** to their servers
2. **Stored indefinitely** (read their ToS)
3. **Processed by third parties** (often offshore)
4. **Subject to subpoenas** (they must comply)
5. **Vulnerable to breaches** (happens regularly)

For a casual meeting, maybe that's fine. For a therapy session, client interview, or confidential research—it's unacceptable.

## FAQ

### Do I need internet to use it?
No. Everything runs locally. You can transcribe on an airplane.

### Where is my data stored?
On your computer, in your user folder. You own it completely.

### Can you access my transcripts?
No. We have no servers, no accounts, no way to access your data.

### Is it HIPAA compliant?
Yes. Since no PHI ever leaves your device, there's no transmission to secure. See [HIPAA-Compliant Transcription](./hipaa-compliant-transcription.md).

### What about attorney-client privilege?
Fully protected. No third party ever touches your data. See [For Attorneys](./for-attorneys.md).

### Can I use this for IRB-approved research?
Yes. Many IRB protocols require local storage. See [For Researchers](./for-researchers.md).

### Is the quality as good as Otter?
Same or better. We use Whisper, the same technology that powers most transcription services.

### Does it work on Windows/Linux?
Yes. We support macOS, Windows, and Linux.
