# Private Transcript Documentation

## Why Private Transcript?

Most transcription services send your audio to the cloud. For many professionals, that's not just inconvenient—it's a liability.

**Private Transcript runs 100% on your device.** No cloud. No uploads. No risk.

## The Problem with Cloud Transcription

When you use Otter, Fireflies, or any cloud service:

1. **Your audio is uploaded** to their servers
2. **Stored indefinitely** (read their ToS)
3. **Processed by third parties** (often offshore)
4. **Subject to subpoenas** (they must comply)
5. **Vulnerable to breaches** (happens regularly)

For a casual meeting, maybe that's fine. For a therapy session, client interview, or confidential research—it's unacceptable.
