## The Meeting Bot Problem

### How Fireflies Works

Fireflies sends a bot named "Fireflies.ai Notetaker" to join your meetings:

1. Bot joins your Zoom/Meet/Teams call
2. Records the entire conversation
3. Uploads to Fireflies servers
4. Processes and stores indefinitely

**Problems with this approach:**

- 🚨 **Everyone knows you're recording** — Bot announces itself
- 🚨 **Makes participants uncomfortable** — "Why is there a bot here?"
- 🚨 **Audio goes to third party** — Privacy lost
- 🚨 **Some companies ban bots** — Security policies block them
- 🚨 **Confidential calls exposed** — Client calls recorded to cloud

### How Private Transcript Works

1. You record locally (system audio or mic)
2. Audio stays on your device
3. Transcribe offline if you want
4. No one knows unless you tell them

**Advantages:**

- ✅ **Discreet** — No bot joining calls
- ✅ **Private** — Audio never uploaded
- ✅ **Works everywhere** — Even when bots are blocked
- ✅ **Your choice to disclose** — Record how you prefer
