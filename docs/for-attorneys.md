# Private Transcript for Attorneys

## The Problem

You just finished a 3-hour client interview. You need a transcript. You consider using Otter or Fireflies, but then you remember:

**Every word your client said is protected by attorney-client privilege.**

If you upload that audio to a cloud service:
- It's stored on their servers
- Processed by their systems (and possibly humans)
- Subject to their privacy policy
- Potentially discoverable in litigation
- A data breach waiting to happen

**That's a malpractice risk.**

## Why Cloud Transcription is Dangerous for Legal Work

### 1. Attorney-Client Privilege at Risk

> "The attorney-client privilege protects confidential communications between attorney and client made for the purpose of obtaining legal advice."

When you upload client audio to a third-party service, you're potentially waiving privilege. The communication is no longer confidential—it's been shared with a third party.

### 2. Third-Party Doctrine

Under the third-party doctrine, information shared with third parties may lose constitutional protection. Cloud services are third parties.

### 3. Subpoena Risk

Cloud providers must comply with subpoenas. If opposing counsel knows you used Otter for depositions, they can subpoena those recordings directly from Otter—bypassing you entirely.

### 4. Data Breach Liability

Cloud services get breached. When they do, your client's confidential information becomes public. You'll have to notify every affected client and explain why their privileged communications are now on the dark web.

### 5. Ethics Rules

ABA Model Rule 1.6(c):
> "A lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to prevent the inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure of, or unauthorized access to, information relating to the representation of a client."

Is uploading to a cloud service "reasonable efforts"? Your bar association may disagree.

| Ethics compliance | Questionable | Clear compliance |
| Offshore processing | Common (check their ToS) | 100% local |

## Questions?

**"Is this really more secure than Otter?"**

Otter stores your audio on their servers. We don't have servers. There's nothing to hack, subpoena, or breach.

**"What if my laptop is stolen?"**

Your transcripts are encrypted with AES-256. Without your password, they're unreadable. (You should also use full-disk encryption—FileVault on Mac, BitLocker on Windows.)

**"Can I use this for court reporters?"**

Yes. Export as court-ready format with page:line numbering.

**"Does this work for depositions via Zoom?"**

Yes. Record system audio to capture both sides of the call, then transcribe locally.
