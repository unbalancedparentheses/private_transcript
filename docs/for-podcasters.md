# Private Transcript for Podcasters & Content Creators

## The Problem

You're producing a podcast. You need transcripts for:
- Show notes
- Blog post repurposing
- SEO and discoverability
- Accessibility compliance
- Editing reference

Cloud transcription works, but you're paying monthly forever. And for multi-hour episodes, that adds up fast.

## FAQ

**"Is the quality as good as Descript?"**

We use Whisper, the same AI that powers most transcription services. Quality is comparable or better than Descript, Otter, etc.

**"Can I edit the transcript like in Descript?"**

You can edit text, but we don't do audio editing. Use Descript, Audacity, or your DAW for that. We're focused on transcription + AI features.

**"What about video podcasts?"**

Yes! Drop in video files (MP4, MOV, etc.) and we'll extract and transcribe the audio. Export SRT/VTT for captions.

**"Does it work with [my podcast host]?"**

Private Transcript creates transcript files you can use anywhere—Spotify, Apple, YouTube, your website. It's not tied to any host.

**"How long does transcription take?"**

Roughly 1/4 of the audio length on Apple Silicon. A 1-hour episode takes about 15 minutes. Faster with Pro on supported hardware.
