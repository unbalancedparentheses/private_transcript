Today I'm starting on the API rate limiting feature. No blockers.\n\nManager: Great progress. Developer Two?\n\nDeveloper Two: I'm still working on the database migration. Ran into an issue with the foreign key constraints. I might need some help from Developer One later today.\n\nDeveloper One: Yeah, just ping me when you're ready. I dealt with similar issues last sprint.\n\nManager: Perfect. What about the QA side?\n\nQA Lead: We finished testing the new export feature. Found three bugs, all minor UI issues. I've already filed them and assigned them to Developer One.\n\nDeveloper One: I saw those. I should be able to knock them out this afternoon.\n\nManager: Excellent. Any other concerns before we wrap up?\n\nDeveloper Two: Just one thing. The staging environment has been slow lately. Can we look into that?\n\nManager: Good point. I'll create a ticket for DevOps to investigate. Anything else? No? Alright, let's have a productive day everyone.",
