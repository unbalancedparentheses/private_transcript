We've got a great topic today. We're talking about the resurgence of local-first software.\n\nHost: Yeah, this is something I've been really excited about. For years everything moved to the cloud, but now we're seeing a pushback.\n\nElena: Exactly. And it's not just about privacy, though that's a huge part of it. It's also about reliability and ownership.\n\nHost: Can you explain what you mean by ownership?\n\nElena: Sure. When your data lives in someone else's cloud, you're dependent on their business decisions. If they shut down or change their pricing, you could lose access to your own data.\n\nHost: We saw that happen with so many apps. Remember when Google killed off Reader?\n\nElena: Oh, I'm still bitter about that one. But it's a perfect example. Millions of users lost their carefully curated feeds overnight.\n\nHost: So what's driving this local-first movement now?\n\nElena: A few things. WebAssembly is making it possible to run complex applications locally. SQLite is having a renaissance. And frankly, people are tired of subscription fatigue.\n\nHost: The subscription model really has gotten out of hand.\n\nElena: Every app wants ten dollars a month now. At some point, people start doing the math.",
